# `crank-native`

A Crank renderer for iOS and Android apps, based on NativeScript.

Under construction! Find out more by contacting [@LinguaBrowse](https://twitter.com/LinguaBrowse) on Twitter.

## Completed so far

[ x ] Filled in all the renderer APIs using React NativeScript's Host Config
[ x ] Have started filling in a NativeScript CLI template, [`tns-template-blank-crank`](https://github.com/shirakaba/tns-template-blank-crank) (access may be private until it's functional)

## Roadmap ðŸ›£

* Complete the DOM interface for NativeScript (this may involve throwing away some/all of the renderer work), or change the core to make more use of the renderer APIs;
* Make a sample app;
* Complete `tns-template-blank-crank` so that users can initialise apps via NativeScript CLI;
* Provide typings for intrinsic elements;
* Implement event handling;
* Create a NativeScript Playground template;
* Write docs;
